Try skipping the really long step for HRC
filter on samp 10-200
try giving the flux component a WCS object
can grab the WCS object from the fits header using astropy
attribute called fluxupsample can use it to block in the result



HRC data finish running through snakemake and then run through jolideco
residuals to the individual observations
ACIS hard band(s) run through snakemake fully and also run through jolideco
WCS to add to observations
ACIS vs HRC data plot for intro
